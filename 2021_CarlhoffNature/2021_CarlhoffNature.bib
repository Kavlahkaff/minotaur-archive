  abstract  = "Much remains unknown about the population history of early
               modern humans in southeast Asia, where the archaeological record
               is sparse and the tropical climate is inimical to the
               preservation of ancient human DNA1. So far, only two
               low-coverage pre-Neolithic human genomes have been sequenced
               from this region. Both are from mainland H{\`o}ab{\`\i}nhian
               hunter-gatherer sites: Pha Faen in Laos, dated to 7939-7751
               calibrated years before present (yr cal BP; present taken as AD
               1950), and Gua Cha in Malaysia (4.4-4.2 kyr cal BP)1. Here we
               report, to our knowledge, the first ancient human genome from
               Wallacea, the oceanic island zone between the Sunda Shelf
               (comprising mainland southeast Asia and the continental islands
               of western Indonesia) and Pleistocene Sahul (Australia-New
               Guinea). We extracted DNA from the petrous bone of a young
               female hunter-gatherer buried 7.3-7.2 kyr cal BP at the
               limestone cave of Leang Panninge2 in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
               Genetic analyses show that this pre-Neolithic forager, who is
               associated with the 'Toalean' technocomplex3,4, shares most
               genetic drift and morphological similarities with present-day
               Papuan and Indigenous Australian groups, yet represents a
               previously unknown divergent human lineage that branched off
               around the time of the split between these populations
               approximately 37,000 years ago5. We also describe Denisovan and
               deep Asian-related ancestries in the Leang Panninge genome, and
               infer their large-scale displacement from the region today.",
